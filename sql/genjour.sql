We live in a culture where weâ€™re constantly shown what we donâ€™t look like, who we arenâ€™t. and what we donâ€™t have. Naturally, self-love and acceptance are at an all-time low. Itâ€™s sad really, we were able to believe in Santa Claus for 8 years, yet we cannot believe in ourselves for even 5 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Self-love refers to an overall self-acceptance of who you are as a person despite the flaws, and what instigates an inner desire to take good care of yourself and focus on what makes you happy. It is one of the most important things to develop in life. Loving yourself is magicalâ€”itâ€™s a divine relationship that will help you radically improve every single aspect of your life.</p>\r\n<p>Weâ€™re living in an era where the self-love revolution is gaining momentum, yet we have trouble doing the work; it goes against everything we were raised to believe. We were never taught self-love in school, and most of us didnâ€™t learn about self-love at our home.</p>\r\n<p>Weâ€™ve developed a habit of constantly criticizing and beating ourselves down. Thus, we view loving ourselves as an extremely difficult and far-fetched concept. So, this is what I want you to do:</p>\r\n<p>I want you to stand in front of the mirror and widen your pupils. Your eyes enlarge when you look at something you love and if you train them to get bigger when you see yourself, maybe you can train yourself to love you too.</p>\r\n<p>A side effect of lack of self-love is lack of self-confidence. When you love yourself, you accept yourself with those shortcomings and it improves your overall self-esteem.</p>\r\n<p>Self-confidence refers to having faith in your own abilities. Being able to trust that, whatever happens, youâ€™ll be able to deal with it.</p>\r\n<p>Why is it then, that we spend most of our time imagining what things will be like when they go wrong, and seeing ourselves being embarrassed, humiliated or failing in some crushing way?</p>\r\n<p>Thereâ€™s a scientific study that shows that if you stand in superhero pose (legs apart, hand on hips, chest out and chin up) for just 5 minutes before a job interview, a big presentation or a really hard task, you will not only feel a lot more confident, you will perform marginally better as well.</p>\r\n<p>So, do what you got to do because you are fragile and indispensable and you deserve to love yourself. And at the end of the day, you are your longest commitment.

Every religion that has come into the world brought the message of love and brotherhood. Those who are indifferent to the welfare of their fellowmen, whose hearts are empty of love, they donâ€™t know the meaning of religionâ€\n                                                                        -Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Humanity and religion are requisites of mankind. While the former bridges the gap and brings people from various walks of life and unites team as a single force, the latter creates a division among the populace which leads to social inequality and sufferings. A neoteric news which surfaced of humanity over religion is about the Muslim man named Razzak Khan Tikari who performed last rites of his Hindu friend Santosh Singh in Madhya Pradeshâ€™s Baitul district, breaking barriers of religion that divide humanity. He was quoted saying that â€œreligion should not become a barrier in friendshipâ€. This proves how much religion has affected the mutual understanding between people. Humanity should be the only religion which should be followed. If you canâ€™t understand the sufferings and grievances of others with your religion, then that religion is of no use. Humanity should be your offering to the world. As Dalai Lama has profoundly said â€œHumanity is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is the kindness.â€ </p>\n\n \n<p>In todayâ€™s world where we have become self-centred egoistic jerks, humanity has become a lost trait. Wars and fights have destroyed the harmony and peace of communities and nations. Wherein humanity was a habit before, now it has become a challenge due to the indulgence of religion. We can strongly say that religion has created enough and more wars than humanity. People have been tortured and killed due to the so called â€˜religionâ€™ to which they belong. There is so much hue and cry in the world but all we do is fight over â€˜my religion is better than yoursâ€™. The cry of poverty, starvation and all are easily forgotten when it comes to religion which creates boundaries of caste, creed, nationality-the conventional religion. Even though we say we are civilized and live in the 21st Century with all the technological advances, we are yet fighting over the 8 letter word called â€˜RELIGIONâ€™. Religion has only created differences between people; an example of this was the Communal Riots that happened in Gujarat which took away the lives of thousands of people. Do we still not understand that conventional religion has only destroyed mankind?. </p>\n\n \n<p>On the other hand, Humanity has opened doors for all, there are no Hindu, Muslim, or Christian people, but those who believe and follow kindness, compassion, respect, love, altruism, and patience. As a famous saying goes, â€œWe were all humans until race disconnected us, religion separated us, politics divided us, and wealth classified usâ€. Religion has made us secluded to our own self. Everybody is judged according to religion. Whether he is a Hindu, or a Muslim, or a Sikh, or a Christian; nobody classifies them as humans; mere mortals. Religion has created a question mark whether people should practice religion or humanity? Because religion has been degrading humanity with its illogical and doltish ideas and practices. We also speak about â€˜unity in diversityâ€™ but do we practice what we preach? Not really. </p>\n\n \n<p>Humanity is where people are given love, care, happiness, freedom, and respect which they deserve. A part of us should be grateful that humanitarians such as Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Dalai Lama, Vivekananda, Nelson Mandela and many others  have shown us what humanity is all about and we should be even more grateful that contemporizes such as Ellen de Generes, Sunita Danuwar, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and others have continued on this path of humanity. We should understand that religion demarcation canâ€™t help you in the pursuit of happiness. Humanity is that ocean where all comes differently but goes together as a single force. </p>\n\n \n<p>We should believe that no religion is higher than humanity. Humanity should be the biggest religion for each and every one as folks should understand that when they die, they will be reduced to something that will be composted. Neither power, name, nor fame will remain with him. A society can be made a better place only if our future generations live in peace and harmony. We need to think about what we are going to deliver to our next generation-hatred or love?-the choice is solely ours. </p>\n\n \n<p>As Mahatma Gandhi said, â€œBe the change you wish to see in the worldâ€.

But sometimes we donâ€™t need someone to dictate whatâ€™s best for us, sometimes we need someone to have our back while we use trial and error to find whatâ€™s best for us ourselves. </p>\n<p>Parents blame gadgets for us not talking to them or spending quality time with the family, but what they donâ€™t realize that when we do interact with them, they judge and make fun of us and the things we have to say. They make us feel like weâ€™re not good enough. They say things like â€œyouâ€™re not even tryingâ€ but we know, we know how hard we try to be perfect for them, how hard we try not to be a disappointment, how hard we try to achieve as much as the neighbourâ€™s kid, or how hard we try to give them something to boast about in front of their friends. </p>\n<p>Our teachers at school are doing their job teaching us math, science, and geography but itâ€™s our familyâ€™s job to teach us self-love, self-esteem, and self-confidence.

The more fortunate may bask in superfluous expenses or detrimental activities; however, if this money is spent in the upliftment of the needy, it will invariably render superior gratification.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Dan Price, the CEO of Gravity Payments, a credit card company, has recently made all his employees very happy. He promised to raise the salary of even the lowest paid clerk by at least 70,000 $ in the next three years. He has planned to do this by cutting his own salary by 30,000 $; moreover, he will also use up to 80% of the companyâ€™s expected 2.2 million $ in profit to pay for the wage increase. In an interview, he was asked why he was doing this and his reply was awe-inspiring. He said he had read an article on happiness. He thereby understood that true happiness lies within philanthropy and growing as a family and not an individual. Currently, CEOs earn nearly 300 times what the average worker makes and this disparity can only be scaled down when the more fortunate wish to do so. The anticipated success of Mr Dan Priceâ€™s decision will elicit other affluent people to make similar decisions which will not only ameliorate the lives of many individuals but also the American economy. </p>\r\n<p>I believe that the hidden concept behind this essay deals with the essence of happiness which one gets from philanthropy. The more fortunate will only embrace the obligation when they understand that one can also bask in otherâ€™s happiness and need not adhere to detrimental activities; moreover, philanthropy is one of the best ways of outlying oneâ€™s resources.

He learns each and everything from this society, from how the people of this society behave, act, respond and react. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if I say that the child, who has just entered this fallible society, is actually learning many things that are wrong from the very beginning? For instance, a newly born child is asked to worship that invisible, non-approachable force that, according to most people, leads us in our way of life.

He starts dreaming of changing the world, he discovers his passion and the desires to turn his imaginations into reality start taking birth in him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strangely, none of this ever happens, and creativity is lost along the way.

Although this statement is a commonly accepted one, it makes one ponder on numerous occasions. For example, why are we made up of such differences if we all are to have an equal stature? And whether the first man was black, white, or brown? </p>\r\n<p>If one studies about our past extensively, you will discover that some historical books state the first man to be born on this earth to be created by God from distinct soils from all over the earth and therefore, his skin was a mixture of distinct colours. Perhaps, if we were all made up of distinct patches of black, brown, and white, â€œMr Stereotypeâ€ would not have been born. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, along the roads of evolution from a regressive environment to a progressive one, mankind has fallen short of producing progressive thinkers. Grouping people under a single title has become a part of every manâ€™s mentality. Stereotyping people around us has become a major part of what defines us and so, we have become subjects to a daily display of â€˜micro-aggressionâ€™.  Micro-aggression is the unintentional act of discriminating members under distinct groups. The generality of it is so deeply rooted in all of us that it makes it even harder to find the distinction to correct ourselves. </p>\r\n<p>We show such behaviours in several instances. Supposedly, if people observe a fair-skinned Indian girl, they remark saying that she resembles a white person, which is considered by many, as a sign of beauty. Somehow, black and brown are considered ugly colours for a womanâ€™s skin. </p>\r\n<p>Similarly, gender prejudices exist as well. If a wife earns more than her husband, the man seems to naturally feel ashamed of himself or suddenly, feel inferior in society. We find similar prejudices based on what media portrays to us. The entire Arab peninsula is regarded by many, as a backward community which is dominated by terrorists who are mainly assumed as Muslims, to such an extent that even when we sit next to a non-Arab, Muslim who keeps a long beard and wears a white cap, we are instantly driven by fear and suspicion. </p>\r\n<p>We have marginalized all people under categories that we find fit for them, regardless of their individual differences. For an extended period, African-Americans were sold as mere slaves as they were considered inferior humans by law. Although, the world sympathizes with them and looks forward towards building a new era where all are considered equal, somehow the unintentional micro-aggression still prevails within us. It has become inevitable to avoid it, living in a society which sees the world with faulty spectacles; which magnifies only certain aspects of certain people to define the whole of his community. </p>\r\n<p>Therefore, we must realise that this highly infectious virus of stereotyping others for their gender, religion, class, and racial differences must be expelled out of our society. This will be possible only if we realise that we are all progenies of the same parent and the fact that we have been divided into such diverse and vibrant communities is that, we should learn to appreciate the differences amongst us.

The year 2016 was the worst case scenario for Indiaâ€™s Twin Balance Sheet problems. Itâ€™s everywhere, this term. And for a layman, itâ€™s just one the problems that the government is facing and nothing that can affect his way of living. Except, of course, he was, and is, wrong. This twin balance sheet issue is affecting us all and we donâ€™t even realize it. The fact that loans are difficult to come by is just the beginning. It is going to affect every single person who is dependent on the economy.  And to understand its implication, it is important to understand the problem. </p>\r\n<p>What is the twin balance sheet problem? </p>\r\n<p>A balance sheet of the company summarises the assets and liabilities of an individual/ institution at any point in time. Twin Balance Sheet problem is twofold, wherein an overleveraged company (a company carrying too much debt) is unable to pay the interest on its loan thereby also increasing bad debts for the bank. It stresses the balance sheet of both the business, and the bank. This leads to a situation where banks are wary of extending further loans and this in turn affects the investments of the economy further, thus leading to cycling situation. </p>\r\n<p>The reason for Indiaâ€™s twin balance sheet problem can be traced to the early 2000s wherein due to a favourable economic situation, the banks extended huge loans to the infrastructure sector, particularly the steel sector. But the global financial crisis of 2007 reduced the growth rate for the sector wherein the overall demand was low. This led to revenue losses from the investment. In such a situation, the RBI increased the interest rate further, fearing inflation. The current situation is that, the infrastructure companies have no revenue to repay the interest or the principal amount and banksâ€™ bad debts are on a rise constantly. </p>\r\n<p>How could it possibly affect a citizen? In 2016, 80% of the bad debts or NPA (non-performing assets) came from the Micro, Small, Medium Enterprise sector (MSMEs). It indicates that the problem is not only deepening but also widening. This will lead to tightening of bank lending and will force a lot of small companies to run out of business. While there is little effect on the agricultural or household sector lending, the small businesses have been badly hit, hampering both, the growth rate, and the employment rate overall. </p>\r\n<p>This situation may also lead to disintermediation of banking sector wherein with the tightening of bank credit, market borrowers will start looking for alternatives like, a capital market for their fund requirement. It will then lead to banks losing their borrowers and their markets. However, this is only possible for big companies because there is still no proper mechanism for MSMEs to raise funds from capital market in the country. </p>\r\n<p>While the situation still hasnâ€™t grown into an economic crisis because most NPAs are with PSBs (Public Sector Banks) which are backed by the government, it will lead to a huge burden on the government who will have to repay it. Effective rehabilitation and restricting of the infrastructure sector at this point seems like the only option which will stress the reserves of the government and the RBI.</p>\r\n<p>Twin Balance Sheet problem has the potential to turn into a virus if problem antidote is not injected into the economy. </p>\r\n', 'Demonetization, Economics, Problem, RBI,Balance Sheet,Taxation,Narendra Modi,8 December', 3, '2017-09-01 10:53:38', 'The-Great-Indian-Problem', 'uploads/journal/rupees-587271_960_720.jpg'),

The media uses imagery as a tool to convey ideas and compliance to establish norms and beliefs, which are very often socially constructed. Cleavage has been inherently associated with female characteristics such as sexually appealing, bold, modern, daring as opposed to a conservative, â€œgood girlâ€ image. Such depiction paves the way for a misconstrued notion of cleavage visibility in public. </p>\n<p>Responses to visible cleavage are as diverse as they may get. It can range from discomfort, embarrassment, a need to judge/ condemn to arousal, feeling provocative or â€œinvitingâ€. It can appear to many as an act of desperation, or a need for attention. The list of myths and conclusions surrounding why a woman knowingly or unknowingly displays her cleavage is very long. </p>\n<p>Let us address an elemental question. What is cleavage, but a part of the human body? You may argue that it serves no rational purpose and can easily be covered up. There is no need to â€˜flashâ€™ it or â€˜flauntâ€™ it. Well, my friend, what if someone asks you to cover up your Adamâ€™s apple or a more heterosexual part, say an earlobe? As silly as this sounds, if cleavage is seen with the same mindset as that of an earlobe, it really shouldnâ€™t be a problem. It is a part of a womanâ€™s body, the way it was created. If she is comfortable with not covering up, then should it matter? </p>\n<p>We all remember how Deepika Padukone responded to Times Of India for objectifying her for the very same thing. There are countless such instances where women have been body shamed and some have retorted. If a woman feels comfortable with her own body, that is a sign of confidence and self-assurance. </p>\n<p>She would want to look, dress, and express herself in alignment to her identity.  Her choice of attire or way of dressing doesnâ€™t define her morals and ethics. But, as a society, we have inculcated this idea deep into our belief systems and today this has declared itself to be a part of our culture. When asked about paintings and depiction of Indian Goddesses from ancient mythology, from the likes of Khajuraho, we chose to look another way. There is no hue and cry made about what our ancestors believed was right, then why start now? </p>\n<p>In some tribal parts of Africa, women roam around without upper clothing. The beach states of countries like the U.S have women wearing little clothing, owing to the climate. Chances of these women being ogled at or objectified for the way they dress are little. Why? Because it is socially accepted. Why is it socially accepted? Because of the right outlook towards the visible skin of women in the aforementioned places. The tribal women folk do not feel objectified or sexualized, simply because there are no propagators of thoughts that say otherwise. In totality, it all boils down to mentality. The definition of secularism in India is conveniently distorted to serve vested interests and hence itâ€™s not deemed fit for a woman to show cleavage. So itâ€™s perhaps regarded alright if youâ€™re an Indian abroad showing cleavage because the culture there allows it. The present times have a very long way to go before it becomes acceptable for an Indian woman to not cover up her cleavage, displayed with or without her knowledge.</p>\n', 'Bra,Breasts,Boobs,Woman,Pullover,Red,Sexy,cleavage,society,orthodox,conservatives,sick mentality,', 15, '2017-09-03 09:04:31', 'Lookind-Down-The-Top', 'uploads/journal/bra-2306600_960_720.jpg'),

But have you ever wondered what it actually is? Why does it exist? Why does it deplete at one point of the time? What happens when we die? What if our whole life is just another dream, and when someone dies, itâ€™s just another morning for them in a different world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us must have spent quite a bit of time pondering over these questions, but we are still unable to find logical answers for the same. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Letâ€™s look at life from a different perspective today, what if life is a mixture of dream and reality? As you think about it you will surely agree that it indeed is a mixture of reality and dreams, and that it canâ€™t just be reality, or dreams. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reality isnâ€™t some romantic movie or a sad play, nor is it a world where every dream comes true, doesnâ€™t matter whether the dream is a good one, or a nightmare. A life without any dreams would probably be like a black line segment on a white canvas, and a life without reality would be just an ugly blot of different colors representing the roller coaster of emotions we go through. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reality and Dreams often come together as a combination of different lines, shapes, colors, and textures, and fuse within each other to create a masterpiece which we call life. Some religions claim that we come from the earth and we go back into it, so, what if the clay which shapes us into living beings is the reality and the potterâ€™s wheel and his hands just our dream? The potter, or our dreams give us a purpose to live and come into this world and be something useful. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people say that existence is futile, or that we live inside a simulation. I believe in this ideology, too, but then, sometimes I step out of my room and I see this world and its beautiful pieces and the art that exists in it in the form of paintings, music, architecture, dance, literature, and organic life forms. Can a simulation be so perfect that you look at something beautiful and you just get lost, lost admiring its beauty and grandeur, soaking in every minute detail and getting amazed as your brain deciphers the meaning of that art piece? You feel your heart beating up as your adrenaline rushes and you are then filled with this sudden newfound respect for life, and you consider yourself lucky to exist at the same time as that piece of art. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To think about it, we donâ€™t celebrate happy dreams, we celebrate happy moments which were once a part of our dreams. We start dreaming from the time we are born and we keep dreaming till we die, some of our dreams are not fulfilled in reality, and some nightmares come real, but we canâ€™t really complain about the sad things in life. Just remember, even our heart beats are in the form of waves which have their own highs and lows, life just ends when the lines are straight. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end keep dreaming, keep enjoying the reality, itâ€™s full of beautiful things. </p>\r\n', 'Life,dreams,reality,love,lie,truth,death,imagination,thought,genjourists,Genjour Generation', 55, '2017-09-03 09:09:03', 'Life:-Mixture-of-Dream-And-Reality', 'uploads/journal/wine-1740554_1280.jpg'),

(16, 'All About Relationships', 'Life', 'Annie Joshi', '<p>There are myriad kinds of love, but most people seek its expression in a romantic relationship with a compatible partner. These relations are the most meaningful part of their lives, providing a source of deep fulfilment. The ability to have a healthy, loving relationship is not innate. A great deal of evidence suggests that the ability to form a stable relationship begins in infancy. In childâ€™s earliest experiences with a caregiver who reliably meets the infantâ€™s needs for food, social contact, care, protection, and stimulation. Those relationships arenâ€™t destiny, but they appear to establish patterns of relating to others. Failed relationships are often a source of great psychological anguish.

NEGATIVE, CHOOSING YOUR BATTLES, SEX, and NO COMPARISONS</b> are the few basic mantras that differ a healthy, romantic relationship from couple to couple.

That is because, those are the relationship stages that most couples never get past. Are you in a new relationship? Or are you in a seasoned relationship with someone youâ€™ve been with for several years? It doesnâ€™t matter how long your relationship has lasted because all relationships go through several phases. </p>\r\n<p>First is the phase which almost starts with an intense attraction and uncontrollable urge to be with each other, where both of you may love the cuddles and each otherâ€™s company. In the infatuation phase, both of you overlook any flaws of each other and only focus on good sides. Second, the understanding stage, where both of you start getting to know each other better. You talk about anything and everything ranging from your favourite food to families and exes, and the list is endless. Also, life seems to be beautiful and romantic. Then comes the third phase, the phase of disturbances. This is usually when both of you confront each other for the first time, over a fight. Next is the opinion phase where the partners develop opinions about one another. As time passes by, both of you know what to expect from the another. Whereas, these expectations about your partner differ in real life, which either leaves you ecstatic, or depressed. </p>\r\n<p>The next phase is the moulding stage, where you have your expectations from an ideal partner. In this stage, both of you try hard to mould each other to fit as per your own wants in a perfect partner. If the relationship survives the moulding phase, both of you may have changed enough for each other and changed your expectations. The next stage is the happy stage, in this the relationship sails smoothly and both of you are blissfully happy with each other. Now that it has been a long time since youâ€™re in a relationship, the stage of doubts creeps in. You start thinking about your past relationships, and your prospects. In this stage, you tie your life with the relationship; if youâ€™re unhappy, you blame it on the relationship. Also, you start making comparisons with other couples and so on. </p>\r\n<p>Next is the bust stage or the stage of sexual exploration. In this phase, your sex life starts to play a pivotal role. In this stage, you either give up on passionate sex or constantly look for ways to have sex more excitingly. </p>\r\n<p>The final is the stage of complete trust, this is a happy phase when both of you love each other and trust each other completely. As pleasant as this final stage of love maybe, itâ€™s still no excuse to take each other lightly or stop appreciating each other, because love is an intense emotion that can be rekindled by anyone else at any time if you fail to express your romance to your lover. </p>\r\n', 'Love,Life,relationships,Phase,Cycle,Birth,Connection,Genjour Generation,genjourists', 7, '2017-09-03 12:45:39', 'All-About-Relationships', 'uploads/journal/nathan-walker-39137.jpg');

(18, 'Depression', 'Self Help', 'Vranda Sharma', '<p>A word so small hides thousands of emotions in it. A word so accurate enough to define a mental illness. Yes! A mental illness. The one who remains in the aura of silence and inner destruction usually is carried away along the winds of depression. </p>\r\n<p>I have a problem and itâ€™s called other people. Other people are better than me. Other people are better friends, better wives, better daughters, and better sisters. Other peoplesâ€™ lives turn out to be better than mine. They get what they want.

Who are these other people? </b></p>\r\n<p>Itâ€™s too easy to scroll through your Facebook timeline and compare yourself with others. Isnâ€™t it frustrating to understand a problematic behaviour and watch yourself do it anyway? Why compare your insides with someone elseâ€™s outsides. Is it a necessity? No, absolutely not. When you start to believe that you arenâ€™t so good, then there is this worm which starts gliding inside you and thatâ€™s called depression. </p>\r\n<p>Depression wants to steal the joy of your life, but you donâ€™t have to let it. Of all the major illnesses, mental or physical, depression has been one of the toughest to subdue. A complex problem like depression is much larger than one scientist or lab can handle. One way to deal with your depression is to simply acknowledge that it exists, and be open about having it. No one wants their life thrown into chaos. That is why a lot of people keep that threat under control and are somehow capable of sustaining a house or a structure that is already rotten. </p>\r\n<p>The worst type of crying wasnâ€™t the kind everyone could seeâ€“the wailing on street corners, the tearing of clothes. No, the worst kind was when your soul wept and no matter what you did, there was no way to comfort it â€“ same is the case with depression. Beware of the rush to label yourself as â€œunfixableâ€. First, depression is not just another â€œplain vanillaâ€ illness. Each personâ€™s episode of depression come in a variable pattern over time that makes his or her experience of illness unique. Everyone experiences an occasional blue mood; depression is a more pervasive experience of repetitive negative rumination, bleak outlook, and lack of energy. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away. People with depression cannot merely â€œpull themselves togetherâ€ and get better. </p>\r\n<p>So, as you can see, depression is not just sadness. It can affect you mentally, through feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and helplessness, and cause loss of motivation and poor concentration. It can affect you physically through changes in weight, sleep patterns, and lower your immunity. But even though depression can cause you to feel helpless and hopeless, there is always help, and there is always hope. </p>\r\n<p>Try to understand that youâ€™re a miracle because you have been one. Itâ€™s your life and itâ€™s given to you because you were worth it and wasting it by being entangled in the threads of depression is surely not a way of living it.

New Year, new batches and new colours were added to the vibrancy of the campus! â€œBharati Vidyapeethâ€ read the entrance behind which was in store lots of experiences, both good and bad, for each one. Leaving their city behind, excitement to explore the new was prominent. Meeting in the canteen, running to catch the lift making sure nobody saw, proxies, mass bunks, lazy morning classes, college events, clubs and endless small things added up to make the amazing whole- college life.</p>\r\n<p>Sharing a lot of experiences with my batch mates, one thing was completely different for me- I had not left my home and my family. On the first day of college, our GFM gave us a big lecture and said â€œI know you guys have left your home and it must be difficult. Also, you guys now have your freedom, so make sure you donâ€™t misuse it.â€ He went on to tell us about a guy who drowned in Khadakwasla dam due to his overwhelming thirst for adventure and how his parents came to Pune crying and how we all need to be careful in life. He went on talking about independence, living on oneâ€™s own, peer pressure to do wrong, hostel life and so many other things for an hour. While everyone else nodded, shared their problems and became a part of the discussion, the realisation of being the odd one out in the class dawned upon me. One more girl in my class and I were the only two people who lived in Pune with family.</p>\r\n<p>In Pune, it is a usual sight to see students from all corners of the country, in fact from all corners of the worlds, studying under the same roof. The city of Pune has an amazing culture which is found adaptable by almost everyone. The tolerance and acceptance towards everyone, no matter where they are from, is something Iâ€™ve found quite commendable about this place. However, different people hold different opinions about a particular place. For me, no matter in which corner of the world I go, coming back to Pune will always be coming back home. So, when I asked people what they felt about coming to Pune, which I did quite often, I heard and grasped attentively as if I were asking my guests about the makeover of my house. Of course, the answers varied from person to person, there was one thing everybody said in common â€“ Pune has made me more responsible and independent.</p>\r\n<p>There is a method birds devise to teach their younger ones how to fly. As soon as they realise they are strong enough to fly, they push their babies out of the nest. It is the fright of falling, that they instinctively flap their wings and soar high into the sky and take their first flight. I feel that is how the experience of everyone who came to Pune on their own was, like falling out of the nest. For me, I donâ€™t know yet what it feels like to leave home. Iâ€™m sure when itâ€™ll happen, itâ€™ll change me and my life in many ways.</p>\r\n<p>Well, is living oneâ€™s college life with family better? Like everything else, both living at home and living out in college life has its pros and cons. While they envy my â€œghar ka khanaâ€, I envy the freedom one gets when one lives outside. â€œSo do you take night outs?â€ one friend asked me. â€œEhh no! I live at homeâ€ I answered. â€œHaha, sad! You can still try,â€ he said giving a short laugh. â€œYes, sure,â€ I replied sarcastically. On the good side, by living with family I donâ€™t face as many financial troubles as my friends living in hostels or flats face. However, living away from college makes commuting really difficult and morning classes are almost impossible to attend. Obviously, the ones living near the campus have a better taste of college life.  The adrenaline rush of coming into a city with an explorerâ€™s spirit, delving into the cityâ€™s history, culture and hotspots! From hostel life to midnight parties, I know there is a lot Iâ€™m missing out. Must be amazing, I think sometimes, to sneak out and travel a little whenever a heart gives out a call to satiate the wanderlust. However, when stress takes over, nothing is more important than momâ€™s arms to ease out all the troubles and I realise what theyâ€™re missing out. Also, I canâ€™t leave the shy and nervous ones unmentioned who are deeply stuck and struggling their way in an unknown city. After all, not all who come here come with a spirit of adventure. Some are homesick and all they need at the moment is the intimate relationships which give them home like feeling but cannot easily approach. For them, leaving their family is like leaving a part of themselves behind. Also, the vulnerable ones find themselves in troubles they cannot share with their families and have to face the problems themselves. Of course, living in a hostel isnâ€™t easy and homesickness is always around the corner, but the feeling of standing on your own feet and being independent is something which leaves the permanent mark of self-control and self-discipline in life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what would I prefer, hostel life or living with family? Like Robert Frost, I once faced two roads diverging. I had an option of joining VIT in Chennai or staying here in Pune. After a lot of dilemmas and reflecting on both the options I chose and the other road was left untrodden. It crosses my mind often, what if I had left my family? Pune is not a city one considers leaving, especially when education is concerned. I have chosen the road and now I have to walk till another diversion comes in sight.

(20, 'Gambling', 'Life', 'Saurabh Sharma', '<p>Is gambling immoral ? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>immoral = transgressing accepted moral rules, corrupt; unscrupulous or unethical\r\nGamble = to play a game of chance for money or property; to bet on an uncertain outcome\r\nWith those definitions in mindâ€¦</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambling is not immoral by any stretch of the imagination. All the vices of humankind arenâ€™t evil or immoral. How we use them, may be. They all have a built-in trap. It is a risk. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the game is fixed or there is cheating involved, sure, that is immoral, but that doesnâ€™t make the gambling itself immoral. It makes the person involved in the fix, immoral. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a person decides to drink all night and lose substantial amounts of money at a casino, that is not immoral. That is a person who made conscious choices to put themselves in a position where they could lose money. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a person has other obligations (family, child support, a mortgage, car payment, etc) and chooses to gamble and loses the money that was meant for those obligations, that does not make gambling immoral. That is just a poor decision and a lack of discipline on the individualâ€™s part. You cannot blame the institution of gambling for a person''s lack of character. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a person doesnâ€™t know that a casino has an advantage and will likely take all their money, that does not make the casino or gambling immoral. That makes the person foolish, greedy, or totally oblivious. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a casino tries to lure you in with flashing lights and a free comped meal for gambling at their establishment, that does not make gambling immoral nor does it make the casino immoral in my opinion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casinos are in the entertainment business. The only difference between gambling at a casino and paying to go to the movies is that there is a chance for greater extremes with gambling â€” extremes in your range of emotions, (potentially) the money you spend, your heart rate. The movies are known. You spend $10.50 per ticket, $9.50 on popcorn and a soda and hope you see a good movie and know it is going to be over in 128 minutes. If you took that same $20 (and were disciplined enough to only spend $20) and put it in a slot machine, that doesnâ€™t make the slot machine immoral. You could win some money, you could lose some (or all) of the money. You could be there for 5 minutes or 5 hours. The difference is clearly there are many more unknowns in gambling, hence the game of chance and betting on uncertain outcomes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I can say that gambling is a ludic fallacy. True games must occur in non-real space. The magic circle, a baseball diamond, doll house, where we can play without risking real-world dangers. Since gambling looks like a game, but uses real money, it is a ludic fallacy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambling often uses specific patterns of activity which trick the brainâ€™s chemical reward mechanism, to produce a kind of addiction. Secondarily, beyond the chemical buzz, the patterns used (4 wins in 10 tries, for instance) can bring on the so-called â€œGamblerâ€™s fallacyâ€ which makes one think you can recover lost money by more gambling, while the opposite is true. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambling also uses advanced game theory mathematics to insure the house wins by a reliable, advantageous ratio. That is how they afford those nice casinos. There is never any question about which party will come out on top. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>So, is gambling a trick, a con, a lie, a theft, a possible addiction. Yes.</b></p>\r\n', 'Gambling,money,ace,spades,hearts,playing cards,problem,habit,bad,life,genjourists,Genjour Generation,Addiction', 6, '2017-09-03 13:31:40', 'Gambling', 'uploads/journal/Gambling.jpg'),
(21, 'Life Of A Corporate Woman', 'Society', 'Sarika Chawla', '<p>In the normal course of life, a woman is always seen playing a vital role starting from the time when she is responsible for the upbringing of the children and managing all her household work, till today when she is not only supporting her family but is also holding a great sense of responsibility towards her job. By nature, she never wants to compromise on anything; neither her family nor her job, so it undoubtedly becomes important for her to maintain a work-life balance. </p>\r\n<p>Corporate life has not only brought changes in the life of a woman but also brought changes in society and the nation, as a whole. If we dive deeply upon the positive and the negative aspects of a womanâ€™s corporate life, weâ€™ll undeniably find various impacts. </p>\r\n<p>1.    She has grown to be stronger, more powerful, independent, and self-confident ever since she has entered into the corporate world. She is capable of taking her own decisions regarding both, her personal and professional growth. Not only this, she is also contributing heavily towards the decisions taken in the family. </p>\r\n<p>2.    Corporate has provided her with a financial stability. From the time she has started earning, she knows where, when, and how she has to spend or invest. </p>\r\n<p>3.    Corporate life at one end has given her an exposure towards various activities but being associated with it, she has some added commitments, targets, & timelines which have increased her stress level and in turn, is leading her to lose her patience and the ill-effects are clearly visible on the family members. </p>\r\n<p>4.    Working for late hours to accomplish the commitments towards her job, she is unable to spend quality time with the children. Not only this, she is also not able to fulfil the expectations of the older generation. As a result, her interest of living in a joint family is hampered. She finds herself in a position to support herself financially and is frustrated enough to leave the family even for trivial issues. Due to her financial independence, she is not only fulfilling the needs of her children but also their demands in terms of brand consciousness. </p>\r\n<p>Corporate life has promisingly showered her with personal, and financial growth but has taken her away from her family. Women are forgetting their moral values towards their family members. Basic moral values which we have inherited from our past parents are not to be forgotten, but we must, in turn, try to inculcate the same in the future generation. We must remain connected to our families, for, with their support, we may grow even faster in our professional life. Growth at both ends, in career and personal front, can lead us towards a blissful happily ever after. </p>\r\n', 'Student,Typing,Keyboard,Text,Woman,Startup,Women,Corporate,Office,Work,Achieve,Care,Children,Family,Society,genjourists,Genjour Generation', 6, '2017-09-05 02:17:22', 'Life-Of-A-Corporate-Woman', 'uploads/journal/student-849824_960_720.jpg'),

(23, 'Beauty Redefined', 'Self Help', 'Divi Gupta', '<p>Beauty, as defined by the Oxford dictionary, is â€˜a combination of qualities giving pleasure to the sight, mind etc.â€™ Now, there is absolutely no mention that this combination of qualities have to be perfect as a prerequisite. So, itâ€™s a mystery how weâ€™ve developed a habit of associating beauty with perfection. Is perfection just a path that makes us feel bad about ourselves? </p>\r\n<p>Beauty is a subjective concept and is multi-dimensional depending upon the knowledge of the observer. For instance, beauty, as perceived by a particle physicist, would be completely different from a traveller who would eventually find beauty in slow speed so he could appreciate the scenery, while for a Formula 1 driver, high speed and completing the race as quickly as possible would be viewed as beautiful. Another thing that oneâ€™s perception of beauty depends on, is the mental state of the observer. Insufficient concentration or simply not being in the right mood are some such examples that can hamper oneâ€™s appreciation of beauty. </p>\r\n<p>Beauty is a state of progress, a phase of development. It is a picture before the artist has carved it out. It is beautiful, therefore, in its time and place. Thus, imperfection in a godly life is really perfection in an incomplete state. </p>\r\n<p>If what we get attracted to is always perfect, eventually getting bored of its perfection is inevitable. Flaws are what make things interesting. They challenge us and in the process, we make some beautiful memories worth cherishing forever. Moreover, nothing that is perfect ever grows. </p>\r\n<p>Across almost the whole world, autumn is considered the most beautiful time of the year. But have you ever wondered why? The leaves spread out on the ground in a haphazard manner isnâ€™t perfect. Neither is an old swing set with chipped paint and wobbly legs. But we still find it beautiful and are reluctant to throw it away for the memories and sentiments attached to it. Similarly, a blossom is beautiful, although compared with the ripe, luscious fruit it seems very imperfect. Or a child, who is not yet a man possessing skill, wisdom, or strength. However, who blames a child for his incompleteness, immaturity or imperfectness? There is beauty in him being imperfect. Same as there is in a childâ€™s smile which can light up the whole room even if he has the front two teeth missing! </p>\r\n<p>Beauty begins the moment we embrace our imperfections as our best features. It is when we drop our act of perfection and reveal our odd, quirky self instead. When we follow our impulses and let our emotions take over. When thereâ€™s the wind in our hair making it fly out in all directions and weâ€™re laughing so openly, we sound like an animal growling. Or when weâ€™re singing at the top of our lungs in an imperfect note. </p>\r\n<p>And when we accept the imperfect life and find joy in the little moments of triumph. Media plays a crucial role in influencing the concept of beauty in our minds. Media has defined for us what beauty is, and what it isnâ€™t. It creates an illusion of what beauty is through the TV, movies, and magazines. Even though beauty is a subjective concept, people in the society still feel they need to conform to certain ideals to look beautiful. </p>\r\n<p>These ideals are the ones established by the media over the years. The media and the beauty industry work hand in hand and thrive off the socially constructed insecurities and perceived flaws of people. They influence people in such a way that people undergo surgeries to fix the flaws they donâ€™t actually have. Media has conditioned people to think that any imperfection is a major flaw that needs to be altered and if not altered, they are not beautiful. Therefore, campaigns like the Dove Real Beauty Campaign need to be encouraged. It is a great example to show how people tend to have a different view of what they really look like. Most women in the campaign defined their beauty in the way they feel and not in the way they actually look like or in the way people really see them. </p>\r\n<p>Chasing perfection to find beauty is a journey with no destination. We need to embrace the imperfections. Perhaps, we really need to stop learning the concept of beauty from fairy tales and start believing it by looking at our reflection in the mirror instead. </p>\r\n<p>So, letâ€™s redefine beauty. Letâ€™s think of it as something in which we find pleasure and little imperfections every day so that we never lose interest. Letâ€™s learn that perfection isnâ€™t what matters. In fact, itâ€™s the very thing that can destroy us if we let it. </p>\r\n<p>Letâ€™s take pride in being a <b> â€˜Beautiful Disasterâ€™. </b></p>\r\n', 'Beauty,Media,Self,Confidence,Fat,Thin,Skinny,change,depression,Wrong,Definition,Right,Beautiful,Ugly,Disaster,bad,Good,Judgmental,Judge,Genjour Generation,genjourists,pleasure,Perfection,Chase', 4, '2017-09-05 02:31:06', 'Beauty-Redefined', 'uploads/journal/monument-412941_1280.jpg'),

(25, 'Importance Of Reading', 'Self Help', 'Neha Patwardhan', '<p>Why books are a miracle we all need.\r\n<p>As many scholars have preached, reading is of utmost importance to our\r\nlives. It is to the soul what meditation is to the body; refreshing, relaxing, and rejuvenating.\r\nNow, of course, we have other means to relax and unwind after a long,\r\ntaxing day, but fancy gadgets simply canâ€™t replace the comfort and\r\nstimulation that a good book offers. Hereâ€™s why: </p>\r\n<p><b>1. Fun</b></p>\r\n<p>First and foremost, books are meant to educate AND ENTERTAIN. Feeling bored\r\nand lonely? Got no places to go? No friends to chill with? All you need is\r\nyour nearest library to get lost into! Just find a book that catches your\r\neye and you are good to go. </p>\r\n<p><b>2. Mental work out</b></p>\r\n<p>Just like your body needs exercise to stay fit, your brain does, too.\r\nReading provides your brain with a great work out regime by improving concentration,\r\nmemory, and increasing your attention span. Studies show that reading can reduce the\r\nrisk of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young children\r\nand slows down the progress of cognitive disorders like dementia and\r\nAlzheimer''s, in the elderly, as stated in a study made by Advanced Cognitive\r\nTraining for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE). </p>\r\n<p><b>3. Moments you canâ€™t forget</b></p>\r\n<p>Can you ever forget the first time Harry found out that heâ€™s a wizard? Or\r\nthe first time Darcy confessed his love for Elizabeth? Books create\r\nmoments which are timeless. They stay with you forever and tug at your\r\nheartstrings every time you read them. Not only that, but it literally\r\nmakes moments unforgettable by strengthening the synapses in your brain\r\neach time you read something. Your memory is virtually endless and it only\r\nexpands each time new information is fed to it. </p>\r\n<p><b>4. Better vocabulary</b></p>\r\n<p>Itâ€™s no secret that reading adds to your repertoire of words. And \r\n a good\r\nvocabulary and articulation come in handy almost everywhere you go!\r\n(Doesnâ€™t hurt to use fancy words to woo the ladies, either </p>\r\n<p><b>5. Builds personality</b></p>\r\n<p>You may be born with dashing good looks, but personality is something\r\nyouâ€™ve got to work on. Thankfully, reading books helps you gain a vast amount\r\nof knowledge and experience. According to a research conducted by the\r\nUniversity of Toronto, reading romance novels, or any artistic novels, can\r\nprovoke empathy and help you understand people better. It also makes one\r\nopen to new experiences. And itâ€™s cheaper and easier than those pretentious\r\npersonality development courses! After all, smart is the new sexy. </p>\r\n<p><b>6. Builds better relationships</b></p>\r\n<p>A reader lives a thousand lives. He lives the characters in the books, he\r\nlives their victories and failures. It gives him a better understanding of the\r\npeople around him. It also makes him sensitive to the cultures all around the\r\nworld, and also more appreciative of art. Readers wonâ€™t be quick to judge,\r\nfor they know thereâ€™s more to the story than just the first page. All of this\r\nhelps them understand othersâ€™ needs and communicate their own needs to\r\nbuild satisfying relationships. </p>\r\n<p><b>7. Knowledge</b></p>\r\n<p>Be it a cheesy Nicholas Sparks or heavily technical articles on\r\nthermodynamics, thereâ€™s always something to take from it. Even reading the\r\nsame book over and over offers new perspectives each time! Plus, knowing\r\nstuff makes you self-confident and a badass. </p>\r\n<p><b>8. Critical thinking</b></p>\r\n<p>Analyzing the story, understanding the characters and solving puzzles and\r\nmysteries can engage your mind in some serious analytical and critical\r\nthinking. It stretches the brain muscles and compels you to think laterally. </p>\r\n<p><b>9.Relaxation technique</b></p>\r\n<p>Have so many problems that you just want to escape your life? You actually\r\ncan, with the help of a good book. Reading lets you escape reality\r\nand live anotherâ€™s life just long enough to give you a fresh perspective on\r\nyour own. Also, reading before bed helps you sleep better. Who wants to join a yoga\r\nclass when you have books? </p>\r\n<p><b>10. Imagination</b></p>\r\n<p>Reading pushes the brain to be creative with its thoughts. Reading about a\r\nparticular place creates an image inside your head which is unique only to\r\nyou because no one else will see that same place exactly as you imagined\r\nit! As opposed to films, which give you ready-made images and restrict your\r\nimagination. (Those who have read the Harry Potter books before watching\r\nthe films will know what Iâ€™m talking about.) </p>\r\n<p>So go on wild adventures, fight dragons, solve homicide cases, romance\r\nhandsome gentleman with estates in Derbyshire, and fall in love over and\r\nover again, all of this while snuggling into a cozy bean bag with a cup of\r\nhot chocolate. Open your imagination.
